		That's me! in front of DCTPC prototype detector at MIT. DCTPC was a small prototype for a directional fast

	<p>I am a high energy physicist working in the field of neutrino experiment. 
	  Neutrinos are elementary particles that only participate in "weak interactions," which means they can 
	  pass through matter (like you or even the entire earth) easily undetected.  But usually there are
	  <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solar_neutrino" style="color: cyan; text-decoration: underline">a lot</a>
	  of them. </p>
	<p> To see neutrinos we work with a
	  <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Super-Kamiokande" style="color: cyan; text-decoration: underline"> big</a>, 
	  <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deep_Underground_Neutrino_Experiment" style="color: cyan; text-decoration: underline">BIG,</a>
	  and even
	  <a href="http://www.hyperk.org" style="color: cyan; text-decoration: underline">BIGGER</a>
	  detectors. It is an exciting job to build and operate these detectors using cutting-edge technologies.
	  An even more fun challenge is to find a rare signal in
	  <a href="https://home.cern/about/computing/processing-what-record" style="color: cyan; text-decoration: underline">big chunk of data</a>.
	  I enjoy making these things work in general, and in particular the software aspect of the effort.</p>
	<p>I am currently involved in
	  <a href="http://www-microboone.fnal.gov" style="color: cyan; text-decoration: underline">MicroBooNE experiment</a>
	  as post-doctoral research scientist at Columbia University. I worked on
	  <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Double_Chooz" style="color: cyan; text-decoration: underline">Double Chooz </a>
	  during my Ph.D at MIT, and
	  <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kamioka_Liquid_Scintillator_Antineutrino_Detector" style="color: cyan; text-decoration: underline">KamLAND</a>
	  while I was at U.C. Berkeley for undergraduate studies.
	     </p>
	<p>My current focus is to apply a machine learning technique, in particular
	  <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deep_learning" style="color: cyan; text-decoration: underline"> deep neural networks</a>
	  to perform data recontruction tasks and physics analysis.</p>
	<p>Here is my
